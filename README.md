- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management
- **body-parser** - Parses incoming request bodies
- **cors** - Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/product-inventory-api.git
cd product-inventory-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

```
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://yourUsername:yourPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/product-inventory?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
Replace `yourUsername` and `yourPassword` with your actual MongoDB credentials.

### 4. Run the Server
Start the server using **nodemon**:
```sh
